Reefknot PHP framework

This is very much a work in progress and at an early stage of development.  I do
think the validation package is up to the point where it's at least useful

The first priority for Reefknot is to build a framework that follows best
practice both in terms of PHP coding and in terms of good coding in general

A reefknot is a common type knot used for a wide range of tasks
